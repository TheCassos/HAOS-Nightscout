## About

Home Assistant allows anyone to create add-on repositories to share their
add-ons for Home Assistant easily. This repository is one of those repositories,
providing extra Home Assistant add-ons for your installation.

The primary goal of this project is to provide you (as a Home Assistant user)
with additional, high quality, add-ons that allow you to take your automated
home to the next level.

Home Assistant instance. It is activated and added by Home Assistant

However, if the repository is missing on your setup, adding this add-ons
repository to your Home Assistant instance is pretty easy. In the
